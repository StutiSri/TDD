Good small commits.

Remember to format the code.

-----------
* Over all good test names describing the intent
* Good solution - simple to read and understand
* Generally good commit messages

To fix:
* The Todos (Cmd+6) added to the code.
* Make sure to red, green, refactor.
* Be more careful with the commits. _Read comments below_

**Commit history**
Be consistent with "mummify" or "mommify".

* 679a7cc - The only refactor step? Why not Red, Green, Refactor? 
* bd160c4 
* 6d8b50f   
* 4a8994b - Committed failing tests? Make your you commit only when tests 
            are passing.
* 17bdf99 - Make sure to commit only 1 change per commit. Here you added 
            some extra asserts in vowel test along with changes specified in 
            your commit message.
* d18f27e - Make sure you commit after every passing test
* c196bfe - Good initial commit
